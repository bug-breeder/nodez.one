# About

I build simple tools for problems I encounter. Sometimes they help other people too.

I'm not trying to change the world - just make a few things a little less annoying.

When I find myself doing something repetitive or frustrating, I try to build a solution. If it works for me and might work for others, I share it here.

**Small acts, giant impacts** - because sometimes fixing one small thing makes everything else a bit easier.
